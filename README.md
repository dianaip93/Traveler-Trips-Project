### Summary:
This project analyzes a traveler trips dataset, transforming raw data into actionable insights for a travel agency. The process began with data cleaning in SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency, followed by exploratory analysis to uncover trends in traveler demographics, preferred destinations, and seasonal patterns. Key business questions were addressed, such as identifying the right target market for each destination, selecting optimal accommodations, and planning trips during peak seasons. A dynamic Tableau dashboard was then developed, allowing users to compare cities, filter by demographics, and dive deeper into travel behaviors. While the datasetâ€™s size poses challenges for query performance, these analyses can be regularly updated as new data is collected, helping the agency adapt to evolving travel trends and make data-driven decisions.

##  Data Acquisition:
Traveler Trip Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/traveler-trip-data

##  Data Preparation:
Focused on data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency, this section highlights techniques like handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors, splitting columns, and standardizing formats to prepare the dataset for analysis.

##  Exploratory Analysis:
Using a traveler trips dataset, I employed SQL queries and analytical techniques to uncover trends based on city, age, and demographics. This included filtering and aggregating data, calculating key metrics, and segmenting travelers to identify patterns in behavior and preferences.


##  Data Visualization: 
Designed and developed a dynamic Tableau dashboard to provide a comprehensive analysis of key travel trends. The dashboard features an interactive city filter, allowing users to compare metrics across all cities or focus on specific cities of interest. Visualizations include insights into the most visited cities, seasonal travel patterns, average traveler age, popular accommodations, trip durations, and spending, empowering stakeholders to explore and understand traveler behaviors with ease.
