# Destination Trends - Project
Using historical traveler trip data, this project analyzes key trends to identify the most popular destinations, optimal travel seasons, and cost comparisons of cities, highlighting the most expensive and affordable locations. I utilized SQL for data extraction and manipulation and created interactive visualizations in Tableau to uncover actionable insights.

### Summary:
Following data preparation, the exploration phase focused on providing actionable insights for a travel agency. During the analysis I aimed to address key business questions, such as identifying the right target market for each destination, selecting optimal accommodations, and planning trips during peak seasons. One of the main challenges I encountered was the size of the dataset, which made some queries less effective. However, as the dataset grows, these queries can be run regularly to provide more useful insights, helping the agency stay on top of changing travel trends and make informed decisions. 

##  Data Acquisition:
Traveler Trip Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/traveler-trip-data

##  Data Preparation:
Focused on data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency, this section highlights techniques like handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors, splitting columns, and standardizing formats to prepare the dataset for analysis.

##  Exploratory Analysis:
Using a traveler trips dataset, I employed SQL queries and analytical techniques to uncover trends based on city, age, and demographics. This included filtering and aggregating data, calculating key metrics, and segmenting travelers to identify patterns in behavior and preferences.


##  Data Visualization: 
Designed and developed a dynamic Tableau dashboard to provide a comprehensive analysis of key travel trends. The dashboard features an interactive city filter, allowing users to compare metrics across all cities or focus on specific cities of interest. Visualizations include insights into the most visited cities, seasonal travel patterns, average traveler age, popular accommodations, trip durations, and spending, empowering stakeholders to explore and understand traveler behaviors with ease.
